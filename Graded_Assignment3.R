# Dear student,
# 
# Follow the instructions carefully and report your results accordingly.
# Using the data (Data_Exercise_Part3 in Genetic_diversity_3 folder) set provided in ILIAS and answer the questions that follow (DO NOT PERFORM QUALITY CONTROL (QC) since QC has been performed):
#   
# 1. Keep two breeds (IrishSuffolk and ScottishBlackface) from the given dataset and upload the bfile (including log file) of your own specific data subset with the two breeds in compressed zip format. (2.5 points) (save file as example: Yourfirtsname_ScottishTexelvsScottishBlackface)
# 
# 2. (a) Perform a standardized FST analysis between the selected breeds and upload the resulting plot with repetitive grey and black colour (use a y-axis of 6 and select only significant region with more than 4 SNPs). (5 points) (save file as example: Yourfirtsname_ScottishTexelvsScottishBlackface)
# 
# 2. (b) Report and upload the top 20 SNPs in an excel file format (xlsx) including chromosome, SNP name, BP position and ZFST values) (5 points). (save file as example: Yourfirtsname_ScottishTexelvsScottishBlackface)
# 
# 3. (a) Perform a XPEHH analysis between the breeds and upload the resulting plot with repetitive grey and black colour (use a y-axis of +8 to -8). (5points). (save file as example: Yourfirtsname_ScottishTexelvsScottishBlackface)
# 
# 3. (b) Report and upload the top 20 SNPs in an excel file (xlsx) including chromosome, SNP name, BP position and XPEHH score) (5 points). (save file as example: Yourfirtsname_ScottishTexelvsScottishBlackface)
# 
# 3. (c) For the top 20 SNPs observed in XPEHH indicate the breed under selection in a new column (column name: Breed) in the same excel sheet. (2.5 points)
# Note:
#   -Breeds to be compared will differ for most people, therefore ensure you only use the breeds allocated to you for analysis.
# You have till thursday next week to submit your results in ILIAS under Genetic_Diversity_Exercise_Part3.
# -Contact me via email if you have any questions.
# 
# Best regards,
